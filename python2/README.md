> "Objects of different types [..] never compare equal; such objects are ordered consistently but arbitrarily (so that sorting a heterogeneous array yields a consistent result)."

> "CPython implementation detail: Objects of different types except numbers are ordered by their type names; objects of the same types that donâ€™t support proper comparison are ordered by their address."
